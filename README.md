# spot_welder
I needed a spot welder to comfortably connect lithium cells for my other projects.
So, after researching some projects found on the internet, I came up with my remix of the ones I liked the most.

The 3D model is mostly based on a similar project from Jim Conner @ https://www.youtube.com/user/ThingsWhichArentWork, but i made mine from scratch based on my transformers dimentions and some models from grabcad.com.

I've used the Nokia 5110 LCD because it is bigger than the OLED.
