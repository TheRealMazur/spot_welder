# spot_welder
I needed a spot welder to comfortably connect lithium cells for my other projects.
So, after researching some projects found on the internet, I came up with my remix of the ones I liked the most.

The 3D model is mostly based on a similar project from Jim Conner @ https://www.youtube.com/user/ThingsWhichArentWork, but I made mine from scratch based on my transformers dimentions and some models from grabcad.com.

I've used the Nokia 5110 LCD because it is bigger than the OLED.

## Features:
- double and single pulse welding modes
- saving and loading pulse times using EEPROM
- 3.5mm jack connector for the trigger switch, allowing multiple trigger options

## To do:
- multiple pulse mode using on/off times and pulse quantity
- zero-crossing detector for better timing in the microcontroller 

The 3D model is avalible here:
